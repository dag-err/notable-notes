# bash

> At its base, a shell is simply a `macro processor` that executes commands. The term `macro processor` means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions. 
> 

```sh
bash -c "echo 1"   # -c read command-string

bash -i            # shell is interactive.

bash -l            # act as if it had been invoked as a login shell
```
