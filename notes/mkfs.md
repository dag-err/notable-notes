# mkfs

> `make filesystem` - build a Linux file system 

## usage
```sh
mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb1      # format the device at /dev/sdb1 with an ext3 file system. 
                            # Note that this will for sure delete all data you might have on that device!

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1         # shortcut command
```
