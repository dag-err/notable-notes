# typing

#### when is type information required ?
| compiletime | runtime   |  
|--           |--         |  
| `static`    | `dynamic` |  

#### how strictly distinguished ?
| | |
|--           |--                       |
| `weak`      | implicit conversion     |
| `strong`    | no implicit conversion  |
| `type-safe` | compiler validates types during compilation |

`implicit conversion`: `string` -> `number`

### language differences

Language       | Static? | Implicit Conversions? | Rules Enforced? | Memory-Safe?
