# typing

#### when is type information required ?
| compiletime | runtime   |  
|--           |--         |  
| `static`    | `dynamic` |  

#### how strictly distinguished ?
| | |
|--           |--                       |
| `weak`      | implicit conversion     |
| `strong`    | no implicit conversion  |
| `type-safe` | compiler validates types during compilation |

`implicit conversion`: `string` -> `number`

### language differences

| Language       | Static? | Implicit Conversions? | Rules Enforced? | Memory-Safe? |
|--              |--       |--                     |--               |--            |
| [[c]]          | Strong  | Depends               | Weak            | Weak         |
| [[java]]       | Strong  | Depends               | Strong          | Strong       |
| haskell        | Strong  | Strong                | Strong          | Strong       |
| [[python]]     | Weak    | Depends               | Strong          | Strong       |
| [[javascript]] | Weak    | Weak                  | Weak            | Strong       |
