# url encoding

[[ascii]], [[ascii character set]]

> URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set.
>   Since URLs often contain characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted into a valid ASCII format.
>   URL encoding replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits.
>   URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign or with %20.
