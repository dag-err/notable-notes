# bash trap

> Defines and activates handlers to be run when the shell receives signals or other conditions

## usage
```sh
trap -l       # print a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers

trap -p CMD   # display the trap commands associated with each SIGNAL_SPEC

trap 'echo "VARIABLE-TRACE> \$DOCKER_HOST= \"$DOCKER_HOST\""' DEBUG   # debugging

trap CMD sig1 sig2  # executes a command when a signal is received by the script

trap "" sig1 sig2   # ignores that signals

trap - sig1 sig2    # resets the action taken when the signal is received to the default
```

## signals
SIGNAME   | SIGVAL          | Effect                  | shortcut
--        | --              | --                      | --
`SIGHUP`  | `1`             | Hangup                  | 
`SIGINT`  | `2`             | Interrupt from keyboard | <kbd>ctrl + c</kbd>
`SIGKILL` | `9`             | Kill-Signal             |
`SIGTERM` | `15`            | Terminate-Signal        |
`SIGSTOP` | `17`,`19`,`23`  | Stop proc               | <kbd>ctl + z </kbd>

`SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` cannot be caught, blocked or ignored !

scratch=$(mktemp -d -t tmp.XXXXXXXX)
function finish {
  rm -rf "$scratch"
}
trap finish EXIT
```


```sh
trap 'echo $varname' EXIT  # useful when you want to print out the values of variables at the point that your script exits

function errtrapÂ {
  es=$?
  echo "ERROR line $1: Command exited with status $es."
}

trap 'errtrap $LINENO' ERR  # is run whenever a command in the surrounding script or function exists with non-zero status

function dbgtrap {
  echo "badvar is $badvar"
}

trap dbgtrap DEBUG  # causes the trap code to be executed before every statement in a function or script
# ...section of code in which the problem occurs...
trap - DEBUG  # turn off the DEBUG trap

function returntrap {
  echo "A return occured"
}

trap returntrap RETURN  # is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the . or source commands finishes executing
```
