# bash type

> A `builtin` is a command provided by the shell, rather than by an external program 

[What is the difference between a builtin command and one that is not? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/11456)

```sh
type ls         # find out if command is avail and if builtin

command -V ls   # same as above

type -F         # list functions
```
