- symbol is immutable

- used in hashes

```ruby
foo = { :ruby => "red"}

x = :my_str
y = :my_str
# :my_str will only be created once, and x and y point to the same area of memory. On the other hand, if you have

x = "my_str"
y = "my_str"
# a string containing my_str will be created twice, and x and y will point to different instances
```
