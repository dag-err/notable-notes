`IF` 
As Philip II of Macedon was conquering Greek city-states left and right, Sparta was left alone. Philip had achieved a crushing victory, and Sparta was relatively weak and without walls. Philip sent a message to the Spartans saying `“If I invade Lakonia you will be destroyed, never to rise again.”` The Spartans replied with one word, `“If.”`
Philip eventually decided to bypass Sparta as it was a poor region and not worth the fight. Neither Philip nor Alexander attacked the Spartans while they ruled.

`“With it or on it”`
Most people are more familiar with the longer `“Come back with this shield or on it,”`, but in everyday use, it was shortened to just five words as a woman handed his shield to a departing soldier.

```
"The vast accumulations of knowledge—or at least of information—deposited by the nineteenth century 
have been responsible for an equally vast ignorance. When there is so much to be known,
when there are so many fields of knowledge in which the same words are used with different meanings,
when every one knows a little about a great many things, 
it becomes increasingly difficult for anyone to know whether he knows what he is talking about or not. 
And when we do not know, or when we do not know enough, we tend always to substitute emotions for thoughts."

— T.S. Eliot, The Sacred Wood
```

```
"He who wants to become master in his field should study its history.
Without historic foundation all knowledge remains incomplete

Misconception: Juniors get mentored from Seniors

```

```
There is something which unites magic and applied science (technology) while separating them from the "wisdom" of earlier ages.

For the wise men of old, the cardinal problem of human life was how to conform the soul to objective reality, and the solution was wisdom, self-discipline, and virtue.

For the modern, the cardinal problem is how to conform reality to the wishes of man, and the solution is a technique.
```

```
If you asked twenty good men to-day what they thought the highest of the virtues,
nineteen of them would reply, Unselfishness.
But if you asked almost any of the great Christians of old he would have replied, 
Love - 

You see what has happened?

A negative term has been substituted for a positive, and this is of more than philological importance. 

The negative ideal of Unselfishness carries with it the suggestion not primarily of securing good things for others, 
but of going without them ourselves, as if our abstinence and not their happiness was the important point.

- C.S. Lewis, The Weight of Glory
```

```
Flint Sky:    Those people in the forest, what did you see on them ?

Jaguar Paw:   I do not understand.

Flint Sky:    Fear. Deep rotting fear. They were infected by it.
              Did you see? Fear is a sickness. It will crawl into the soul of anyone who engages it. 
              It has tainted your peace already. I did not raise you to see you live with fear. 
              Strike it from your heart. Do not bring it into our village.

- apocalypto
```

```
Between stimulus and response, there is a space.
